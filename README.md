# React-Course

A project from the React course I took on Udemy to use the language in my thesis.

## ðŸ“¦ Installation & Running the Project
To set up and run the project locally, follow these steps:

1. **Install dependencies**
   ```sh
   npm install
   ```

2. **Start the local development server**
   ```sh
   npm run dev
   ```

This will launch the project on a local development server, allowing you to test and modify the button component in real-time.

## ðŸ“„ License
This project is open-source and available for modification or extension.
